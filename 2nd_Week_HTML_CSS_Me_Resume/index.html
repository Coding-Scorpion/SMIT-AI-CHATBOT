            <p>The "Heart Disease Prediction" system is based on predictive modeling, which predicts the likelihood of a user having a particular disease based on the symptoms provided as input. The system analyzes the user's input and outputs the probability of the disease. This prediction is made using five different techniques: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest Algorithms. The average prediction accuracy probability achieved is 83%.</p>
